#app/models/contact.rb
#If we creat a ruby class in app/models
#and name the file the same thing as the class but snake_case version of class
#then rails will automatically require that class in EVERY other file in our app 
#SO: no more having to write out require statements
class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base

  #code
